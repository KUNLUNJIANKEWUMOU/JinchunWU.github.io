I am about to graduate from Southeast University (SEU). I am currently engaged in doctoral research in the Institute of Product Design and Human-Computer Interaction, Department of Industrial Design, Southeast University. My research interests include neural design and advanced Human-computer interaction, and multi-modal and multi-sensory integration of human-computer interaction based on human factors engineering. My main research during my PhD was the use of electrophysiological techniques such as EEG, fNIRS, eye tracking, EMG, and multimodal brain imaging techniques such as EEG hyperscanning and fNIRS hyperscanning to study the behavior characteristics of creative teams in the process of innovative design and its cross-brain coupling neural mechanism. In addition, my research interests during the doctoral period also involved the human factor ergonomics evaluation of urban light environment, the human-machine interface design of complex information systems and the multi-sensory integration research of XR.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Chengqi Xue from School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University. I was also advised by Prof. Ching-Chiuan Yen from Keio-NUS CUTE Center, Smart Systems Institute, National University of Singapore during my joint Ph.d period (2024.1-2025.1). Also, I was advised by Prof. Shengdong Zhao from Synteraction Lab, Smart Systems Institute, National University of Singapore during my joint Ph.d period (2024.7-2025.1).
